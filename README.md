Hi, I'm Akira Sudoh. One of those who was involved in [the inception of Carbon Design System](http://web.archive.org/web/20180407034141/http:/www.howdesign.com/design-creativity/behind-the-design/ibm-design-carbon-design-system/), the design system for IBM, where I mentored the team as well as created its [vanilla JavaScript architecture](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/v10.0.0/src/globals/js/mixins). [One of the biggest contributors](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/graphs/contributors) of [Carbon Design System](https://carbondesignsystem.com). The author of [Carbon Design System variant of Web Components standard](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-web-components). Have been focused on IBM front-end development by leading, mentoring and working with global teams. Led/drove [adoption of Web Components standard to IBM.com sites](https://ibmdotcom-web-components.mybluemix.net/), too. Led the Japan team of Lotus Notes' web client, [Lotus iNotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Lotus_iNotes), for more than a decade, which was a co-project of Westford, MA and Japan, where I transcended the team for Japanese-specific solution to the very core of Lotus iNotes development.
